  Hi, I am Jai Makhija. I've had a passion for race cars and fighter jets ever since I was a kid, 
  which eventually propelled me to work in startups building launch vehicles, commmercial EVs, and military drones.
  Beyond work, I am a devoted Formula 1 fan and spend my weekends outdoors, hiking and running.
