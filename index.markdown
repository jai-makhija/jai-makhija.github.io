  Hi, I am Jai Makhija. I have always been chasing adrenaline ever since I discovered race cars and fighter jets at the age of 10, which eventually propelled me to work in startups building launch vehicles, commmercial EVs, and military drones, focussing on aerodynamic aspect of hardware development. Beyond work, I am a devoted Formula 1 fan and spend my weekends outdoors either hiking or running.
