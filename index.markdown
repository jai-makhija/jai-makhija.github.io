  Hi, I am Jai Makhija. I have always been chasing adrenaline ever since I discovered race cars and fighter jets at the age of 10. Wanting to build something cool, I have worked in startups desiging and manufacturing launch vehicles, commmercial EVs, and military drones, with my focus on hardware development. Beyond work, I am a devoted Formula 1 fan and spend my weekends outdoors either hiking or running.
