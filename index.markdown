  * Hi, I am **Jai Makhija** and I have been chasing adrenaline ever since I discovered race cars and fighter jets at the age of 10. 
  * Wanting to build something as a culminaton of adventure, big dreams and a creative spark, I got a Masters in Race Car Aerodynamics from Southampton and have worked in startups desiging and manufacturing launch vehicles, EVs, and military drones, focussing on hardware development.
  * Beyond work, I am a passionate Formula 1 fan and spend my weekends outdoors either hiking or running. 
  * Always excited to talk to people about things that excite them, feel free to reach out to me at jaimakhija98@gmail.com
