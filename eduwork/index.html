<h3> Chief Engineer - Aerodynamics at Green Aero Propulsion Pvt. Ltd. </h3>
<h4> Jan 2025 - present </h4>
<p>More information coming soon</p>

<h3> Masters in Race Car Aerodynamics at University of Southampton </h3>
<h4> Sep 2023 - Sep 2024 </h4>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>Group Design Project: “Aerodynamic optimisation of the Formula Student car” <br />
Set up a streamlined CFD workflow that replicated the physical behaviour observed in the wind tunnel tests to perform aerodynamic optimisation of the race car’s side wing whose downforce and efficiency increased by 2.5 times.</li>
  <li>Dissertation: “Numerical study of motorsport overtake manoeuvre during crosswind conditions” <br />
Performed wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations to analyse the influence of crosswinds on the aerodynamic forces, balance, and efficiency of race cars while they overtake each other to provide insights into optimal overtaking paths in different crosswind conditions.</li>
  <li>Formula Student: Developed a CFD workflow to conduct Conjugate Heat Transfer simulations of the race car’s battery pack, assessing its thermal performance and cooling requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3> CFD Engineer at Euler Motors Pvt. Ltd. </h3>
<h4> Mar 2022 - Aug 2023 </h4>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/Euler_1.png" alt="Euler_1" width="600" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Initiated the development of a physics-based vehicle model and ECM model of the Lithium-ion battery cell on Simulink, reducing reliance on physical testing for battery range evaluation.</li>
  <li>Designed the thermal management system of the battery pack with a streamlined, automated open-source CFD workflow built around OpenFOAM.</li>
  <li>Led the analysis, testing, and validation of prototype immersion-cooled battery packs, a cooling strategy used by only 10 teams globally, including Audi RS Dakar and Koenigsegg Regera.</li>
  <li>Developed a fast-charging algorithm for LFP battery packs, enabling 10–90% charge in 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Set up a CFD workflow to optimise the vehicle’s aerodynamic design with OpenFOAM.</li>
  <li>Validated and refined heat generation models for CFD simulations using experimental data.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Aerodynamics Engineer at Agnikul Cosmos Pvt. Ltd. </h3>
<h4> Jul 2020 - Feb 2022 </h4>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/Agnikul_1.png" alt="Agnikul_1" width="700" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Developed a Finite Difference Method solver to estimate transient aerodynamic heating effects during the flight and determine thermal insulation requirements for the vehicle.</li>
  <li>Performed CFD benchmarking by validating the vehicle’s aerodynamic coefficients and surface pressure data with wind tunnel results across multiple flow regimes.</li>
  <li>Transitioned the CFD workflow to OpenFOAM on cloud computing services, reducing licensing and server costs with on-demand simulations.</li>
  <li>Integrated an analytical model to evaluate skin friction coefficients, enabling lower cell count and run time for the CFD simulations with higher wall Y+.</li>
  <li>Analysed forces from high-speed winds during the pre-launch phase using empirical and numerical methods, to address structural requirements of the vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology </h3>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>Student team: Served as a Brake Engineer in designing and building an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) that won two national Quad Bike design competitions in 2018.</li>
  <li>Thesis: “Numerical Investigation of Flow over Launch Vehicle at transonic Mach numbers” <br />
Performed CFD simulations to study the effects of angle of attack and strap-on boosters on aerodynamic forces and shockwave formation on the launch vehicle in transonic flow.</li>
</ul>
