<h3> Masters in Race Car Aerodynamics at University of Southampton </h3> 
<h4> Sep 2023 - Sep 2024 </h4>

* Group Design Project: Aerodynamic optimisation of the Formula Student car <br>
* Dissertation: [Numerical Investigation on Motorsport Overtake Manoeuvre in Crosswind Conditions](https://www.sae.org/papers/numerical-investigation-motorsport-overtake-manoeuvre-crosswind-conditions-2025-01-8773) <br>
* Formula Student: Developed a CFD workflow to conduct Conjugate Heat Transfer simulations of the race car's battery pack, assessing its thermal performance and cooling requirements.

<h3> CFD Engineer at Euler Motors</h3>
<h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <span>Commercial Electric Vehicle Manufacturer</span>
  <span>Mar 2020 - Aug 2023</span>
</h4>

* Initiated the development of a physics-based vehicle model and ECM model of the Lithium-ion battery cell on Simulink, reducing reliance on physical testing for battery range evaluation.
* Designed the thermal management system of the battery pack with a streamlined, automated open-source CFD workflow built around OpenFOAM.
* Led the analysis, testing, and validation of prototype immersion-cooled battery packs, a cooling strategy used by only 10 teams globally, including Audi RS Dakar and Koenigsegg Regera.
* Developed a fast-charging algorithm for LFP battery packs, enabling 10–90% charge in 45 minutes.
* Set up a CFD workflow to optimise the vehicle’s aerodynamic design with OpenFOAM.
* Validated and refined heat generation models for CFD simulations using experimental data.

<h3> Aerodynamics Engineer at Agnikul Cosmos </h3> 
<h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <span>Satellite Launch Vehicle Manufacturer</span>
  <span>Jul 2020 - Feb 2022</span>
</h4>

* Developed a Finite Difference Method solver to estimate transient aerodynamic heating effects during the flight and determine thermal insulation requirements for the vehicle.
* Performed CFD benchmarking by validating the vehicle's aerodynamic coefficients and surface pressure data with wind tunnel results across multiple flow regimes.
* Transitioned the CFD workflow to OpenFOAM on cloud computing services, reducing licensing and server costs with on-demand simulations.
* Integrated an analytical model to evaluate skin friction coefficients, enabling lower cell count and run time for the CFD simulations with higher wall Y+.
* Analysed forces from high-speed winds during the pre-launch phase using empirical and numerical methods, to address structural requirements of the vehicle.

<h3> Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology </h3> 
<h4> Jul 2016 - Jun 2020 </h4>

* Student team: Worked as a Brake Engineer in designing and building an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) that won two national Quad Bike design competitions in 2018.
