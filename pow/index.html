<h3> Chief Engineer - Aerodynamics at Green Aero Propulsion </h3>
<h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <span>Micro Gas Turbine Engine Manufacturer</span>
  <span>Jan 2025 - present</span>
</h4>

<p>More information coming soon</p>

<h3> Masters in Race Car Aerodynamics at University of Southampton </h3>
<h4> Sep 2023 - Sep 2024 </h4>

<ul>
  <li>Group Design Project: “Aerodynamic optimisation of the Formula Student car” <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Set up a CFD workflow to replicate the airflow observed in the wind tunnel within a 5% error margin.</li>
      <li>Optimised the race car’s side wing resulting in 2.5 times higher downforce and efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dissertation: “Numerical study of motorsport overtake manoeuvre during crosswind conditions” <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Performed wind tunnel tests to chracterise the aerodynamic performance of race cars during crosswinds.</li>
      <li>Developed optimal overtaking paths for the attacking driver based on crosswind conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Formula Student: Developed a CFD workflow to conduct Conjugate Heat Transfer simulations of the race car’s battery pack, assessing its thermal performance and cooling requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3> CFD Engineer at Euler Motors</h3>
<h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <span>Commercial Electric Vehicle Manufacturer</span>
  <span>Mar 2020 - Aug 2023</span>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Initiated the development of a physics-based vehicle model and ECM model of the Lithium-ion battery cell on Simulink, reducing reliance on physical testing for battery range evaluation.</li>
  <li>Designed the thermal management system of the battery pack with a streamlined, automated open-source CFD workflow built around OpenFOAM.</li>
  <li>Led the analysis, testing, and validation of prototype immersion-cooled battery packs, a cooling strategy used by only 10 teams globally, including Audi RS Dakar and Koenigsegg Regera.</li>
  <li>Developed a fast-charging algorithm for LFP battery packs, enabling 10–90% charge in 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>Set up a CFD workflow to optimise the vehicle’s aerodynamic design with OpenFOAM.</li>
  <li>Validated and refined heat generation models for CFD simulations using experimental data.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Aerodynamics Engineer at Agnikul Cosmos </h3>
<h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <span>Satellite Launch Vehicle Manufacturer</span>
  <span>Jul 2020 - Feb 2022</span>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Developed a Finite Difference Method solver to estimate transient aerodynamic heating effects during the flight and determine thermal insulation requirements for the vehicle.</li>
  <li>Performed CFD benchmarking by validating the vehicle’s aerodynamic coefficients and surface pressure data with wind tunnel results across multiple flow regimes.</li>
  <li>Transitioned the CFD workflow to OpenFOAM on cloud computing services, reducing licensing and server costs with on-demand simulations.</li>
  <li>Integrated an analytical model to evaluate skin friction coefficients, enabling lower cell count and run time for the CFD simulations with higher wall Y+.</li>
  <li>Analysed forces from high-speed winds during the pre-launch phase using empirical and numerical methods, to address structural requirements of the vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology </h3>
<h4> Jul 2016 - Jun 2020 </h4>

<ul>
  <li>Student team: Worked as a Brake Engineer in designing and building an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) that won two national Quad Bike design competitions in 2018.</li>
  <li>Thesis: “Numerical Investigation of Flow over Launch Vehicle at transonic Mach numbers” <br />
Performed CFD simulations to study the effects of angle of attack and strap-on boosters on aerodynamic forces and shockwave formation on the launch vehicle in transonic flow.</li>
</ul>
